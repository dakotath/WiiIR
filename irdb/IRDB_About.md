# make.py Documentation

## Overview

The `make.py` script is a utility designed to work with the **Flipper-IRDB** GitHub repository. Its primary function is to take the supported devices in the repository and convert them into a **master JSON database file**. This database is subsequently used by the Wii converter to enable compatibility with Wii IR and other implemented applications.
