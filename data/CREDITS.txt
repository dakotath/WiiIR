============================================================

WiiIR — also known during development as “ControlMii” — is the result of
a long, dedicated effort fueled by persistence, late nights, experimentation,
and a passion for understanding the technologies that shaped the Nintendo Wii.

This project was not created overnight. WiiIR stands upon months of deep
research into obscure hardware behaviors, reverse-engineering practices,
archived documentation, and long-lost technical articles buried in the far
corners of the internet. Much of the information required to make WiiIR
possible no longer exists in modern circulation, and recovering it required
a combination of patience, luck, and determination. Every breakthrough was
earned through careful study, testing, and verification.

------------------------------------------------------------
                    CORE DEVELOPMENT TEAM
------------------------------------------------------------

WiiIR (ControlMii) was designed, engineered, and brought to life by:

    • Dakota Thorpe  
    • Larsen Vallecillo  

Their commitment was the driving force behind every component of the project.
From hardware analysis, IR protocol decoding, and software design, to
countless prototype iterations and debugging sessions — Dakota and Larsen
invested both time and passion to ensure this project functioned naturally
on real Wii hardware.

------------------------------------------------------------
                     DEVELOPMENT TIMELINE
------------------------------------------------------------

The journey of WiiIR consisted of:

    • ~6 months of research and investigation  
    • ~1.5 years of development, refinement, and testing before the initial release  

During this time, both developers dove into microcontroller behavior,
oscilloscope captures, Wii Remote IR communication, hardware timing quirks,
and the interaction between custom IR patterns and the Wii’s sensor systems.
Every version brought new discoveries, challenges, and improvements.

            LEAD DEVELOPER PERSONAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
------------------------------------------------------------

A special note from the core lead developer, **Dakota Thorpe**:

At the time of WiiIR’s initial publication, Dakota was still a **high school
student**, balancing coursework, exams, extracurricular responsibilities,
and everyday life alongside the intense process of building and refining
this project. Despite these challenges, development continued steadily —
often late at night, during weekends, or in between school obligations.

Dakota extends sincere gratitude to everyone who remained patient throughout
the project’s long development period. Thank you for supporting this effort,
for waiting through delays, and for believing that the final release would
be worth the time it took to complete. Your encouragement and understanding
made the journey possible.

------------------------------------------------------------
                     TESTING & VERIFICATION
------------------------------------------------------------

A massive thank-you goes out to all **12 early testers** who volunteered to
evaluate WiiIR on real Wii consoles. Their feedback, bug reports, patience,
and willingness to test experimental builds contributed directly to the
polish, stability, and accuracy of the final product.

Your help transformed concepts into reality — WiiIR would not be the same
without you.

------------------------------------------------------------
                     SPECIAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
------------------------------------------------------------

We extend our gratitude to **SB-Projects.net** for their exceptionally
well-documented and clearly formatted information on infrared communication
protocols. Their detailed breakdowns were invaluable references during the
reverse-engineering phase of the project, offering clarity where modern
documentation fell short.

Without their work, several aspects of this project would have taken far
longer to decode.

------------------------------------------------------------
                       FINAL THANK YOU
------------------------------------------------------------

To everyone who supported the concept, encouraged development, contributed
information, or simply showed interest in understanding the Wii’s IR system:
thank you. WiiIR exists because of curiosity, community effort, and a shared
desire to keep classic hardware alive, accessible, and better understood.
