# Wii IR Project

## About the Project

**Wii IR** is a proof-of-concept project aimed at implementing a free and open-source infrared blaster library for Wii Homebrew. This project explores the potential of enabling infrared communication capabilities for various applications within the Wii Homebrew ecosystem.

The library demonstrates the feasibility of integrating infrared functionality into homebrew projects, providing developers with a foundational tool to build and expand upon. While this project is open-source in concept, it is currently not publicly released and remains under restricted access.
